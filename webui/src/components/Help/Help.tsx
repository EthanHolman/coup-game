          Coup is a card game of deception. The deck contains 3 copies of 5
          different characters.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 2 cards. These
          cards, face-down, determine the actions you may take on your turn, and
          what actions you may block.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, you can lie about which cards you actually have! Just don't
          get caught bluffing â€” if another player challenges your bluff, you'll
          be forced to reveal (lose) one of your cards!
          <br />
          <br />
          The game is over when only one player is left with an unrevealed card.
